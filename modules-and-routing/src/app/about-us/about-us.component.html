         Bounty hunters were individuals who could be hired to capture or kill a designated target. The target would have 
         a price or bounty on their heads that would be collected by the bounty hunter upon successful capture or proof of death. 
         Bounty hunters would sometimes team together as part of a larger mission or to handle dangerous targets.
